# Movie-Website
A website that lists favourite movies and plays trailer through youtube.

Run the entertainment_center.py file in python 3.x to generate a html file dynamically.

If you just want to see the generated page then you can look at it by opening the movie_trailers.html in your browser.
The page will be opened preferrably in new window of your default browser.
